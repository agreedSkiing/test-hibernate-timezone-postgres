## Reason for project

This project was created to test the connection time to postgres database with Etc/GMT-1 time zone (GMT+1).

Test passes as expected

### Database looks

Database columns looks normal since no_time_zone is made without any time zone field and is stored as a plain time, other two are converted to UTC as postgres does.

```bash output
podman exec -it postgres /bin/bash
c7b596f783c9:/# psql -U user quarkus
psql (13.9)
Type "help" for help.
